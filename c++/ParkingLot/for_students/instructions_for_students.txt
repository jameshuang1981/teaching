This is the assignment for presentation “Introduction to Inheritance in C++”, given by Yuxiao Huang at Northeastern University (during a job interview).

In this assignment students will be asked to design a toy parking lot in C++.

Specifically, students should implement “Vehicle.h” and “Vehicle.cpp”, given “ParkingLot.h”, “ParkingLot.cpp” and “main.cpp”.

Here are some hints.
1. The parking lot has only one line (as shown in “ParkingLot.h”).

2. The parking lot allows two kinds of Vehicle, Car and Bus (as shown in “main.cpp”).

3. A Vehicle has 3 activities, search for available space, occupy the space, and free the space (as shown in “main.cpp”). Use functions in “ParkingLot.h” to implement these activities. 

4. A Car searches for available space from left to right in the parking lot, while a Bus does this from right to left.

5. A Car takes 1 space while a Bus takes 2.

6. Before implementing “Vehicle.h” and “Vehicle.cpp”,
6.1 read “main.cpp” to see the test cases and their expected output;
6.2 think about why “Vehicle.h” is hidden;
6.3 think about the similarities and differences between Car and Bus; what method we learnt from the presentation can be used to implement them.

Please feel free to contact me if there are any questions.
